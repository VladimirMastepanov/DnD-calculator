### DnD-calculator
___
DnD-calculator is an interactive React application that allows users to build a custom calculator by arranging components in "Constructor Mode" and then using it in "Runtime Mode." This project demonstrates the power of drag-and-drop interfaces and provides a flexible, hands-on experience for users.

#### Features
* Constructor Mode: Build your own calculator by dragging elements from the left panel into the work area. Elements become semi-transparent and inactive in the source panel once moved but remain interactive in the drop area.

* Calculator Mode: After constructing your calculator, switch to runtime mode to perform calculations just like with a standard calculator.

#### Key Technologies
* React and React-DOM for building the interface.
* Jotai for state management.
* React-DnD for drag-and-drop functionality.
